# Sem_4_MultiParadigm_Programming

I decided to include a cover page to explain my approach tot his assignment. I hope this will help you better understand my approach. 


Project Introduction
Assignment: Basic Shop Code with C & Java  Full Functionality Shop Program with C & Java
 
My Project approach a.k.a. the backwards approach: 
Find a model with some similar functionality in Java  Introduce full assignment functionality to that model instead of the original model  go back to C and work to work down a level now understanding the broad structure of the language better

Firstly, I followed the videos and understood the approach to building the foundation of the shop in both C and Java. 
After spending come time setting up environments that worked. I tried to build upon the “Basic Shop Parameters” you had provided us in C however building methods from scratch was a step too far and I clearly had not got enough knowledge of the language to do this. I tried to took some additional tutorials in Codacademy but still struggled to get started. I moved onto Java and found it was not much easier. 
Finally, I found a similar program that was simpler than your Java example but could get me off the ground. I simply started it as a test (hence the package is called ”Test”)  however I again struggled to integrate the new “base code” with yours therefore, right or wrong, I proceeded with the test code as I was able to interpret it better, manipulate it and  in the end get some functionality from it. It still took many, may hours of work to understand what was needed and trying to make that happen with null-pointer-exception and static vs non-static method challenges worked through frequently. I am sure this is a different approach to that of many students, but I felt I learned more from the assignment being able to progress my program further using this process. 
My recommendation is to actually teach this backwards. Starting with Java and working down a level to C. There is more online support for Java and this was really needed.

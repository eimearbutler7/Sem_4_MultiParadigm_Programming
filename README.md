# Sem_4_MultiParadigm_Programming

This repository contains the MultiParadigm Programming Assignment (Oct/Nov 2019).

The 2 primary documents are:
- the Shop.c for the demonstration using the C programming Language 
- the test.java package for the demonstration using the Java programming Language 

All supplimentary documentation begins with a "z_" in order for it to remain at the bottom of the list of files.

# PROJECT APPROACH
I decided to include my approach to this assignment in order to help you better understand my work but please do reach out to me if you have any questions. 

**Project Aim**
Assignment: Basic Shop Code with C & Java -> Full Functionality Shop Program with C & Java
 
**My Project approach was to take a backwards route:** 
After spending come time setting up environments that worked, I got no where trying to build on the C model provided (at least before further tutorials were posted) so I moved onto Java and effectively began there. 

I again struggled to get off the ground so I found a model with some similar functionality in Github. [The file is available here.](https://github.com/vivianamarquez-2013/Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java/blob/master/II-8-12-OnlineShop)

I simply started it as a test (hence the package is called ”Test”) and I used this as a base to work from and introduce all the functionality require for the assignment. Ideally with time, I could have taken those principles back into the original format but sadly I did not get to do this. I am sure this is a different approach to that of many students, but I felt I learned more from the assignment being able to progress my program further using this process. 

With this better working knowledge of similar but higher level Java and the further tutorials that were now available I was able to then work down a level in C building on the assigned base code.

I restarted the work with C work and was able to get some functionality implemented.
